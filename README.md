The Biocode Field Information Management System (FIMS) validates field data and tracks samples to be used in laboratory information management systems (LIMS). You can visit a working Biocode FIMS instance at http://biscicol.org/ . Biocode FIMS is supported from several sources:

Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation as part of the Moorea Biocode Project (http://biocode.berkeley.edu/)
Diversity of the IndoPacific (http://indopacificnetwork.wikispaces.com/), funded by the National Science Foundation
The Barcode of Wildlife Project (http://www.barcodeofwildlife.org/)
The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History (http://www.mnh.si.edu/)
The Berkeley Natural History Museums (http://bnhm.berkeley.edu/)
