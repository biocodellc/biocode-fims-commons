The Biocode Field Information Management System (FIMS) validates field data and tracks physical samples and collecting events, using globally unique and persistent identifiers, for reference in collections management systems, laboratory information management systems, seqence repositories, and publications. You can visit a working Biocode FIMS instance at http://biscicol.org/

FIMS Documentation is located at http://fims.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Biocode FIMS is supported from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation as part of the Moorea Biocode Project (http://biocode.berkeley.edu/), the National Science Foundation as part of the Diversity of the IndoPacific (http://indopacificnetwork.wikispaces.com/), the Barcode of Wildlife Project (http://www.barcodeofwildlife.org/), the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History (http://www.mnh.si.edu/),  the Berkeley Natural History Museums (http://bnhm.berkeley.edu/), and the Autonomous Reef Monitoring Network (website coming soon).
